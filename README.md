Attribute-Value Prediction from E-Commerce Product Descriptions
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict attribute-value pairs (e.g., color, size, brand) from unstructured product descriptions using NLP techniques.

Key Features:
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
Feature Engineering: Custom features for improved model input.
Unseen Value Handling: Special focus on predicting rare or unseen attribute-values.
Model Optimization: Fine-tuned using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn for accuracy.
Technologies:
Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, SpaCy
NLP for text analysis
Data Preprocessing for cleaning and feature extraction
Results:
Enhanced accuracy in predicting attribute-value pairs, including unseen data.
Efficient feature engineering and preprocessing.
Future Improvements:
Advanced handling of unseen values.
Expansion to more product categories.
